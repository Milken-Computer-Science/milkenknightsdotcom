<h3>Non-Milken Students/Parents</h3>
<p>Any Milken Community Schools student (grades 7-12, included) can join Team 1836. 
If you are considering Milken as a middle or high school, we encourage you to visit 
<a href="http://www.milkenschool.org/Page/ADMISSION">Milken’s Admissions page</a> to learn more about attending Milken. If you tour the school, 
make sure to mention you are interested in robotics so that there is ample time for you 
to visit our shop. Additionally, if you are interested in touring our shop at another time, 
you can contact us. 
<br><br>
If you are not in the Los Angeles area or Milken is not an option for you, there are many other 
FIRST® Robotics Competition teams in the surrounding areas and around the world. The FIRST® Website 
has a <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/team-event-search#type=teams&sort=name&programs=FRC&year=2018">complete listing</a>. Younger students can also check out FIRST® LEGO® League Junior (6 to 10 years), 
FIRST® LEGO® League (9-14 years), and FIRST® Tech Challenge (7-12 grade).</p>
<h3>Current Milken Students</h3>
<p>All Milken students are welcomed to join the team and encouraged to stop by 
the shop at get a feel for our program. Students do not need any technical knowledge 
to join the team. We have both technical and nontechnical roles available and each 
student will be trained in whatever it is they would like to pursue. Our preseason 
meetings begin in August and the build season begins in January. If you are interested 
in joining or have additional questions, contact us.<p>
<br><br>
<h3>Companies</h3>
<p>Team 1836 is always looking for new sponsors. If you think that your company might 
be a good match with us, please feel free to reach out to us. The team is able to 
utilize donations of any kind. Current sponsors provide supplies, machinery, funds, and more. 
A listing of our current sponsors is available, on the <a href="index.html">home page</a>.</p>
<h3>Individuals</h3>
<p>Mentorship is an essential component of any FIRST® team. Team 1836 is able to utilize 
the guidance of any skilled individual whether it be technical (mechanical engineering, 
electrical engineering, programing, design, etc.) or nontechnical (marketing, public relations, 
community engagement and service, etc.). If you believe you would be a good match with our team, 
please contact us.</p>
